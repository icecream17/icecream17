Nowadays, my main contributions go towards proofs in Metamath. Before that I contributed a bit to the Atom text editor right before it was deprecated for Pulsar-Edit.

I made many projects in HTML/JS/CSS + TS and to a lesser extent Python and Rust. Right now, I'm interested in and learning about cybersecurity.
